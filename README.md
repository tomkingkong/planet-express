#### Planet Express
Tired of the same old daily commute? Take a trip to space!
Planet Express takes users on a journey into the cosmos, 
while at the comfort of their own mass transit vehicle.

For this solo project I was tasked with developing an App under three, near random constraints  
for a User, API, and Technology; which were:
1. Mass Transit Users
2. NASA API
3. jQuery

I have also included Hubble API and NewsAPI, for visuals and added information.


## Set Up

Clone this project

Run `npm install` from the root directory

Run `npm start` and visit localhost:3000 in your browser

You can run tests with `npm test`

<strong>Note*  
In order to make a few of the fetch calls, CORS will need to be enabled in your browser.  
This project was meant to be viewed on mobile, and will look awkward on screens > 500px width.</strong>


#### Development
After a day of determining the goals of my app, I worked in Sketch to develop wireframes and a prototype to aid in building out the React components.    
Wireframes/prototype:
